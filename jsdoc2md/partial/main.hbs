Scramjet core
---------------

This is the minimal, dependency free version of [`scramjet`](https://github.com/signicode/scramjet) used as of Scramjet
version 3.0.0 as a base for `scramjet` and scramjet plugins.

Unless you are sure, you should be better off with using the main repo and module.

## What does it do?

Scramjet is a powerful, yet simple functional stream programming framework written on top of node.js object streams that
exposes a standards inspired javascript API and written fully in native ES6. Thanks to it some built in optimizations
scramjet is much faster than similar frameworks in asynchronous operations (like for instance calling an API).

It is built upon the logic behind three well known javascript array operations - namingly map, filter and reduce. This
means that if you've ever performed operations on an Array in JavaScript - you already know Scramjet like the back of
your hand.

The main advantage of scramjet is running asynchronous operations on your data streams. First of all it allows you to
perform the transformations both synchronously and asynchronously by using the same API - so now you can "map" your
stream from whatever source and call any number of API's consecutively.

The benchmarks are punblished in the [scramjet-benchmark repo](https://github.com/signicode/scramjet-benchmark).

## Example

How about a CSV parser of all the parkings in the city of Wrocław from http://www.wroclaw.pl/open-data/...

```javascript
const request = require("request");
const StringStream = require("scramjet").StringStream;

let columns = null;
request.get("http://www.wroclaw.pl/open-data/opendata/its/parkingi/parkingi.csv")
    .pipe(new StringStream())
    .split("\n")
    .parse((line) => line.split(";"))
    .pop(1, (data) => columns = data)
    .map((data) => columns.reduce((acc, id, i) => (acc[id] = data[i], acc), {}))
    .on("data", console.log.bind(console))
```

## API Docs

Here's the list of the exposed classes and methods, please review the specific documentation for details:

* [```scramjet.DataStream```](docs/data-stream.md) - the base class for all scramjet classes.
* [```scramjet.BufferStream```](docs/buffer-stream.md) - a DataStream of Buffers.
* [```scramjet.StringStream```](docs/string-stream.md) - a DataStream of Strings.
* [```scramjet.MultiStream```](docs/multi-stream.md) - a DataStream of Strings.
* [```scramjet.plugin```](docs/index.md) - method for adding plugins, please see the docs
* [more on plugins](docs/plugins.md) - a description and link.

Note that:

* Most of the methods take a callback argument that operates on the stream items.
* The callback, unless it's stated otherwise, will receive an argument with the next chunk.
* If you want to perform your operations asynchronously, return a Promise, otherwise just return the right value.

## Usage

Scramjet uses functional programming to run transformations on your data streams in a fashion very similar to the well
known event-stream node module. Most transformations are done by passing a transform function. You can write your
function in two ways:

1. Synchronous

 Example: a simple stream transform that outputs a stream of objects of the same id property and the length of the value string.

 ```javascript
    datastream.map(
        (item) => ({id: item.id, length: item.value.length})
    )
 ```

2. Asynchronous (using Promises)

 Example: A simple stream that fetches an url mentioned in the incoming object

 ```javascript
    datastream.map(
        (item) => new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
            request(item.url, (err, res, data) => {
                if (err)
                    reject(err); // will emit an "error" event on the stream
                else
                    resolve(data);
            });
        })
    )
 ```

The actual logic of this transform function is as if you passed your function to the ```then``` method of a Promise
resolved with the data from the input stream.

## Help wanted

The project need's your help! There's lots of work to do - transforming and muxing, joining and splitting, browserifying, modularizing, documenting and issuing those issues.
